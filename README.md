# Tenx USB Missile Launcher driver for NodeJS - fires foam rockets

# Tenx Driver
This module contains a driver that opens a Tenx USB Missle Launcher using the Node USB library and then sends Left, Right, Up, Down, Stop and Fire commands.

# Console Application
A companion program, keyboard.js reads the command line keyboard so that the Cursor Keys can be used to turn the missile launcher.

# Test Hardware
Tested with a UK Marks and Spencer USB Missile Launcher running on a Raspberry Pi.
